This project is a simple eCommerce web app has been developed by React js.
I used vite for development environment, redux toolkit for state management, formik and yup for form validations, tailwindcss for styling and fakestore api for server side.
This web app is very simple and minimal with cart, wishlist, fake checkout and fake signup and login but you can't add product to cart or wishlist.
Some features like rating or discount and more has been removed due to lack of data in fakestore api.

Thank you for review
